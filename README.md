# InterSign



#Project Overview
InterSign is an AI-powered platform that translates spoken language into sign language through realistic avatars. The platform aims to bridge communication barriers faced by the deaf community, especially in Tunisia and broader Africa. By providing real-time sign language interpretation for media, education, and video communication, InterSign ensures inclusivity and accessibility for all.

#Problem Addressed
Many deaf individuals face significant challenges in accessing media, educational content, and communication tools. Traditional methods fail to provide real-time, integrated sign language translation, leaving the deaf community at a disadvantage. This problem is particularly acute in Africa, where resources for the deaf community are limited.

# Solution
InterSign leverages generative AI models to create avatars that perform real-time sign language translation. These avatars are customizable and can be integrated into various applications, providing an inclusive experience for deaf users. The platform supports multiple local languages and can be used in media, education, and communication platforms.

#H ow It Works
InterSign captures the audio output from the user's device and uses AI models to convert the audio into sign language. The translated sign language is then displayed using a generative AI avatar that overlays on top of other applications. This avatar can be moved around the screen, providing flexibility and ease of use.

In addition to translating audio to sign language, InterSign also enables users to communicate through sign language using their webcam. The application uses computer vision models to recognize the user's sign language gestures and convert them into speech, which is then output through the user's microphone. This bidirectional translation facilitates seamless communication between deaf and hearing individuals. 

# Key Features
Real-Time Speech-to-Sign Translation: Converts spoken language into sign language in real-time.
Local Language Support: Available in multiple languages to cater to different regions.
Customizable Avatars: Users can choose avatars that best represent them.
Cross-Platform Integration: Compatible with desktop and mobile applications.
Unique and Innovative Aspects
InterSign is the first platform in Tunisia to offer such a comprehensive solution for the deaf community. The use of generative AI models for real-time translation and avatar creation sets it apart from other solutions. The platform's flexibility and scalability make it a groundbreaking tool for enhancing communication and accessibility.

Technology Stack
Backend: Laravel or Django
Frontend: Flutter
AI Models: Generative AI models for real-time sign language translation and avatar creation
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
Deployment: Docker, AWS

We have 2 AI models : one that translate sign language to text to speech and another one from speech to text to sign language represented by avatar

AI Model Integration
Speech Recognition: The AI model listens to spoken language and converts it into text.
Language Processing: The text is processed to understand context and meaning.
Sign Language Generation: The processed text is translated into sign language gestures.
Avatar Animation: The generated gestures are performed by the avatar in real-time.
