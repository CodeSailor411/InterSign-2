## Application Installation Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the installation process for the Flutter desktop application.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)

## Building from source

Follow these steps to build and install the app on your device:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/darkisabsent/InterSign-2.git
   ```

2. **Move to the directory containing the Flutter code and switch to the main branch**
   ```
    cd frontend
    ```
    ```
    git switch main
    ```

3. **Get Dependencies:**
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the App:**
    - Connect your Android/iOS device to your computer.
    - Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your Android device.
    - Run the following command:
      ```
      flutter run
      ```
   This will build the app and install it on your connected device.

5. **Alternatively, Use an Emulator:**
    - Open Android Studio and launch the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager.
    - Create a new virtual device and start the emulator.
    - Once the emulator is running, repeat step 4.
